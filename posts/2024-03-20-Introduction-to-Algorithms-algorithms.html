<p class="post-paragraph">In this post, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of algorithms and their importance in computer science.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph"><h3 class="post-subsection">What is an Algorithm?</h3></p>
<p class="post-paragraph">An algorithm is a <strong class="post-bold">step-by-step</strong> procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. It's like a recipe that tells you exactly what to do to achieve a desired result.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph"><h3 class="post-subsection">Key Characteristics</h3></p>
<p class="post-paragraph">Every algorithm should have these important properties:
<ul class="post-list">
    <li class="post-list-item"><strong class="post-bold">Input</strong>: The algorithm takes some input
    </li><li class="post-list-item"><strong class="post-bold">Output</strong>: It produces some output
    </li><li class="post-list-item"><strong class="post-bold">Definiteness</strong>: Each step is precisely defined
    </li><li class="post-list-item"><strong class="post-bold">Finiteness</strong>: It must terminate after a finite number of steps
    </li><li class="post-list-item"><strong class="post-bold">Effectiveness</strong>: Each step must be basic enough to be carried out
</ul></p>
<p class="post-paragraph"><h3 class="post-subsection">Example: Binary Search</h3></p>
<p class="post-paragraph">Let's look at a simple example of an algorithm: binary search. This algorithm finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph">The time complexity of binary search is <span class="post-math">O(\log n)</span>, which is much more efficient than linear search's <span class="post-math">O(n)</span>.</p>
<p class="post-paragraph"><ol class="post-ordered-list">
    </li><li class="post-list-item">Compare the target value to the middle element of the array
    </li><li class="post-list-item">If the target value matches the middle element, return its position
    </li><li class="post-list-item">If the target value is less than the middle element, search the left half
    </li><li class="post-list-item">If the target value is greater than the middle element, search the right half
    </li>\item Repeat until the target is found or the search space is empty
</ol> </p>
