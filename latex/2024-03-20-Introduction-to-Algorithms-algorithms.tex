\section{Introduction to Algorithms}

In this post, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of algorithms and their importance in computer science.

\subsection{What is an Algorithm?}

An algorithm is a \textbf{step-by-step} procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task. It's like a recipe that tells you exactly what to do to achieve a desired result.

\subsection{Key Characteristics}

Every algorithm should have these important properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Input}: The algorithm takes some input
    \item \textbf{Output}: It produces some output
    \item \textbf{Definiteness}: Each step is precisely defined
    \item \textbf{Finiteness}: It must terminate after a finite number of steps
    \item \textbf{Effectiveness}: Each step must be basic enough to be carried out
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Example: Binary Search}

Let's look at a simple example of an algorithm: binary search. This algorithm finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.

The time complexity of binary search is $O(\log n)$, which is much more efficient than linear search's $O(n)$.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compare the target value to the middle element of the array
    \item If the target value matches the middle element, return its position
    \item If the target value is less than the middle element, search the left half
    \item If the target value is greater than the middle element, search the right half
    \item Repeat until the target is found or the search space is empty
\end{enumerate}
